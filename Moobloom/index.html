            <h2>What is a Moobloom?</h2>
            <p><strong>
                A Moobloom is a flower-cow hybrid, originating from the game <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/about-earth" title="About Minecraft Earth">"Minecraft Earth"</a>. They are an extremely rare species, with only a 0.5% drop chance from cow tappables in Earth (thats about 1 moobloom in every 200 tappables!). Of course, like their close relative, also hybrid cow, the Mooshroom (mushroom-cow) they like to live in some of the hardest to find places, only appearing in the rare and magical Flower Forests, with scenery that's just as colourful as them. A moobloom contributes to the ecosystem by providing fresh flowers for bees to pollinate with, as well as just being the cutest friend duo you've seen! Mooblooms are a colourful and cheery friend made out of happiness and fun to bring cheer to your world all year round.

            <h2>Fun Fact:</h2>
            <p><strong>
                Mooblooms and bees would be the first cross-mob interaction between two unique passive mobs in Minecraft! (presumably bees follow mooblooms and collect pollen, a potentially very cute sight!)
