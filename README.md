# mroinky.github.io
 a site to test html and web stuff
 this site is not and never will be "finished" and is always subject to change
 feel free to use issues to suggest things or point out visual problems on your display. (this one is helpful as i use 1920x1080 and a lot of px measurements based on larger screens that need fixing)
